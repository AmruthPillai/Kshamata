# Kshamata
**A Product of JP Morgan's Code for Good 2017 Hackathon**  
This project aims to help the non-profit organization, Kshamata, in data entry and management.

## About the Organization
Human trafficking is a continuing issue in India, and the city of Mumbai is a major location for such trafficking. Efforts by law enforcement authorities do periodically rescue victims’ or more appropriately survivors, of the trafficking ‘industry’. However, the experience of the founders of Kshamata shows that successful reintegration occurred in very low numbers. Kshamata has therefore developed a project aimed at effective reintegration of the survivors into society, based on a survivor centric socio-economic rehabilitation approach.
